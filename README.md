# tomhartung.com-amp

Starting a new, non-drupal version of tomhartung.com as a minimal Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) site.

# Subsites

Following are the "standard" subsites - in `Sites/subsites` - of this site:

- `tomh.info` - copied the code from the repo to here, so we can let go of that domain name
- `resume` - link only to `/var/www/subsites/resume`
- `idMyGadget` - link only to `/var/www/subsites/idMyGadget`

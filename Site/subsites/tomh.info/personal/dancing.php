<h1>Dancing</h1>
<p>
The past several months I have been focusing on getting the
<a href="http://tomhartung.com">tomhartung.com</a>
site up and have been taking dance classes only somewhat sporadically.
</p>
<h2>The latest dancing news</h2>
<p>
The good news is, my knee feels much better, so I deleted all the stuff about that from this page.
I don't even think about it anymore!
The moral is, if you enjoy dancing and have chronic pain someplace (e.g., knees, shoulders, etc.),
I highly recommend going to see a chiropractor as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned
<a href="personal.php">elsewhere</a>,
this site is now pretty much obsolete.

Despite the fact that I wrote the following section about Musicality back in 2004,
it's really not so out-of-date.
Although I've made <em>some</em> progress in overcoming my shyness, and
can dance freestyle in public to a <em>certain</em> extent, I still have a ways to go.
Because it's still relevant, I see no reason to delete what's already here, so if you don't mind
reading something written a few years ago, by all means, continue!
</p>
<p>
Also further down on this page, is my
<a href="#saga">saga of dancing</a>,
written in 2002.
</p>
<h2>Musicality</h2>
<p>
Recently I've been reading about the history of dance, and
have been buying some videos of modern dance in particular.
I like modern dance the best, and I believe it's for the same
reason I like jazz, the blues, bluegrass, hip-hop, and film noir:
because all of these are uniquely American art forms.
</p>
<h3>Isadora Duncan 101</h3>
<p>
So far the dancer who impresses me the most is Isadora Duncan (1877-1927).
Over the years, a few of my teachers have mentioned <q>musicality,</q>
but I had no clue what that term meant until I saw a video of
one of Isadora's dances.
</p>
<p>
During Isadora's time, someone who wanted to dance would have to study ballet.
Although she loved classical music, she didn't care
for ballet's <q>affected grace and toe-walking,</q>
so she had to invent her own movements.
</p>
<p>
She would stand for hours, with her hands over her solar plexus,
<q>seeking that dance which might be the divine expression of
the human spirit through the medium of the body's movement.</q>
</p>
<p>
To quote further:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<blockquote>
After many months, when I had learned to concentrate all my force to
this one Centre, I found that thereafter when I listed to music the rays
and vibrations of the music streamed to this one fount of light within
me -- there they reflected themselves in Spiritual Vision, not the brain's
mirror, but the soul's, and from this vision I could express them in Dance.

<p>
Ok, so you can take computer graphics classes in the Math department of
most any college, and learn how to put colored pixels on the screen.
But if, on the other hand, you take a computer graphics class in the Art department,
and the teacher makes you read Kandinsky's <q>Point and Line to Plane,</q>
you might learn how to <em>apply</em> that knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, you can take social and performance dance classes in
untold numbers of studios accross the land, and learn some movements that
will have some <q>built-in musicality</q> for a given genre of music.
But you will have to learn about and study someone like Isadora Duncan
to learn how to <em>apply that</em> knowledge.
</p>
<h3>Applying Isadora's principles</h3>
<p>
Before learning about Isadora, I had basically been learning movements.
Not having an interest in classical music,
and not really wanting to learn Isadora's movements,
<!-- (frankly, if one was to describe her style in
     a single a word, it could be called <q>frolicking</q>), -->
my path is clear.
</p>
<p>
What I need to do is apply Isadora's principles to my situation.
</p>
<h4>What's easy</h4>
<p>
Because I've been listening to rock and roll for many decades,
and don't have to worry about leading a partner,
this is incredibly easy for me to do at rock 'n' roll shows.
</p>
<p>
For example, for the post-Isadora-tomh, going to shows that feature
free-flowing, jazzy rock, like The Dead, will never be the same.
It's like I can feel a direct connection from the music to my body.
Another example is punk rock, a genre that expresses ample amounts
of emotion and, in some cases at least (e.g., Sonic Youth and
Tomahawk more so than The Melvins), plenty of synchopation.
</p>
<p>
It's also fairly easy for me to do this in the privacy of my own
home, where in addition to not having to worry about leading,
there is no one watching and making me feel self-conscious.
</p>
<h4>What's not so easy</h4>
<p>
Because I've been taking social dance classes for many years,
and have the obligation to lead a partner, this is extremely difficult
for me to do while dancing swing and salsa.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, my work is cut out for me.
I can feel the emotions, and can express them in movements in
some cases, but not all.
A little pain in a leg might keep me from learning other people's
movements, but it is not going to stop me from expressing
what's in my soul.
</p>
<p>
When doing something, it's important to have a goal....
</p>
<p>
So that's the current state of things, here and now in 2004.
What follows is the
"<a name="saga" id="saga">saga of dancing</a>"
I originally put up on this site in 2002.
</p>
<h2>Tomh's saga of dancing in Denver</h2>
<p>
When I was young, growing up in the suburbs of
Richmond, Virginia, people just didn't dance.
At least, no one I knew did.
It was the age of The Beatles, CSNY, The Dead, Who, Byrds, Kinks, Doors,
Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, etc.
Everyone wanted to be a Rock 'n' Roll star.
</p>

<h3>Learning about music and learning about learning</h3>
<p>
I played trumpet from sixth grade through high school, and
in my senior year was in a rock band with some classmates.
We had a full ensemble, but couldn't find a reliable bass player.
</p>
<p>
Also in my senior year I took a class in music theory and solfeggio
(ear and voice training).
Prior to this I'd learned only <em>specific songs</em>,
this was like learning <em>all of music</em>.
Maybe it was the private lessons or maybe it was
having the discipline to do the scales and
arpeggios more than knowing the theory
(undoubtedly it was all of the above) but
about this time I began to improvise on the horn, and
jam along with Freddy Hubbard and Miles Davis records.
<!-- (It always sounded best when no one was around!) --!>
</p>
<p>
Back in those days, if you wanted to be a rock 'n' roll star,
trumpet was obviously the wrong way to go.
So after graduation from Hell School, err, High School,
I bought a used Framus hollow-body electric bass for $50.
Thanks I am sure to working with  solfeggio,
it was surprisingly easy to learn and
play Paul McCartney's simple yet <em>incredibly beautiful</em>
bass lines.
<!-- I listened to the Beatles so much in those days, I
can't hardly stand to hear them anymore! --!>
Soon ex-trumpeter Phil Lesh (bass player for the Dead) became
my main source of inspiration.
Later I used what I learned in that same music theory
class to teach myself guitar.
</p>
<h3>Using the knowledge and always learning more</h3>
<p>
Some years later I got a gig playing stand-up bass in a bluegrass band.
I was still young and had a bit of an attitude.
The deal was, the money didn't matter much,
<!-- (I made plenty of that programming in Cobol) --!>
what was important was that sometime during each set
I'd get to play guitar and sing one of my "hippie songs," like
<em>Me and My Uncle</em>, <em>Sweet Virginia</em>,
<em>You Ain't Goin' Nowhere</em>, and <em>Friend of the Devil</em>.
</p>
<p>
The bluegrass band was fine for a few years until I started
getting into Punk Rock.
Somehow it seemed that doing a Clash song, even one from the laid-back
album <em>Sandinista</em>, in a bluegrass style just wouldn't work....
</p>
<p>
That music theory class also wound up having a profound effect on
how I learned photography and dancing.
Pursuing an interest in photography, I wound up taking a lot of
art history and even a drawing class.
Eventually I found the "music theory of visual arts" in
writings by Mondrian and Kandinsky.
I remember specifically finding Kandinsky's book
<a href="http://store.doverpublications.com/0486238083.html"
  onMouseOver="linkStatus();return true;"
  onMouseOut="setStatusToDefault();return true;"
  target="dance_window"> 
Point and Line to Plane</A> to be fascinating.
<!-- I wonder how many web designers have read it?
Well, that sort of abstract knowledge is difficult to understand
and it probably won't help you earn more money, so why bother? --!>
<!-- That education probably explains why I like
Film Noir more than many people. --!>
</p>
<p>
Soon after this, in Graduate School, I studied Artificial Intelligence.
At this time I became consciously aware of the difference between
being smart vs. being intelligent, and why training is cheaper
and easier than education.
Like, duh!
Obviously in these changing times, <em>education</em> is the way to go!
</p>
<p>
Please don't hate me because I get bored easily!
I write about doing all this stuff, but I don't do any of
it very well.
I just get bored with everything.
Lately it's become obvious that I enjoy the learning part the most....
To do something well, you need to stick with it,
and actually that <em>is</em> something I <em>have</em> been doing recently,
which is why you should come to the

  CPRD Student Showcases</a>!
</p>

<h3>How I got interested in dancing</h3>
<p>
It all started one day in February, 1997, when
I got a coupon in the mail for 20% off on dance lessons at a local
ballroom dancing studio named <em>The World of Dance</em>.
It sounded like something different, possibly fun, and,
according to conventional wisdom, a good way to meet women.
I cogitated on the coupon for a week or two and, being bored with my
life at that time (did I mention it was in February?),
finally used the coupon a few days before it expired.
</p>
<p>
Over the next four years I took private lessons and
all sorts of classes at The World of Dance, and
learned swing (jitterbug and lindy hop),
salsa, cha-cha, rumba, waltz, samba, merengue, fox-trot, tango, and even
a little polka.
When the teachers I had there retired, I started taking lessons
and classes at
<a href="http://www.karenleedance.com"
  onMouseOver="linkStatus();return true;"
  onMouseOut="setStatusToDefault();return true;"
  target="dance_window"> 
  Karen Lee Dance International</a> (KLDI).
</p>

<h3>Looking for the music theory of dancing</h3>
<p>
By 2001, I had a solid background in the basics of partner dancing,
but still had difficulty in the more advanced classes.
It was frustrating to spend $100 in a weekend to take classes from
a visiting instructor like Frankie Manning, and be able to
remember only maybe about 10-25% of what I learned.
</p>
<p>
It was about this time I was wondering, "what is the music theory of dancing?
What can I learn that will be like learning <em>all of dancing</em>?"
What movements are the alphabet and vocabulary of dancing?
Where can I get <em>education</em> instead of <em>training</em>?
</p>
<p>
From dancing with beginners, I learned that women who have
taken ballet were much easier to lead than those who hadn't.
Also, the teachers I had for private lessons had taken jazz, ballet, tap,
and other performance dance classes.
After hearing me complain about my lack of memory
("my brain is full!") when trying to recall recently-learned moves,
some of my dance partners suggested I take some classes at a place like
<a href="http://www.cleoparkerdance.org"
         onMouseOver="linkStatus();return true;"
         onMouseOut="setStatusToDefault();return true;"
         target="dance_window">
Cleo Parker Robinson's Dance School (CPRD)</a> (CPRD).
</p>

<h3>A mini-Juilliard right in my back yard!</h3>
<p>
As it happens, CPRD is about two blocks from where I live.
And in June of 2001, I found myself unemployed, with enough
savings to get by on, but definitely not enough to continue with the
private lessons and classes in partner dancing.
So in July, 2001 I mustered up the courage to take a
Beginning Jazz dance class at CPRD.
It was huge fun and a great work-out, and
I felt totally liberated, finally for once being able
to dance without having to worry about leading!
</p>
<p>
As the summer of 2001 came to an end, Hip-hop and Salsa classes came next,
and as the economy and World Trade Center Towers went their way,
so did my hopes of finding employment that fall anyway, and
for who knows how long after that.
</p>
<p>
Just as I was in the bluegrass band,
(or just about anyone else in any bluegrass, jazz, punk rock, etc.
band for that matter)
Cleo's definitely not in it for the money.
Her
<!-- a href="http://www.cleoparkerdance.org/cleo_2000/html/history.html"
         onMouseOver="linkStatus();return true;"
         onMouseOut="setStatusToDefault();return true;"
         target="dance_window">mission -->
mission is for everyone to dance as much as possible.
You can take unlimited classes for only $110/month
(the private lessons I was taking cost $50/hour).
I took full advantage of her generosity, and by 2002 I was
taking ten classes per week (for a cost of around $2/hour).
</p>
<p>
Taking classes at Cleo's not only helped me keep off the sauce
(during a previous spat of unemployment I definitely
started drinking too much alcohol),
the exercise also proved invaluable in helping me to
<a href="../personal/theLatest-old.php"
         onMouseOver="linkStatus();return true;"
         onMouseOut="setStatusToDefault();return true;"
         target="theLatest_window">
quit smoking</a>.
</p>

<h3>The alphabet and vocabulary of dance</h3>
<p>
That's what they teach at CPRD: the alphabet and vocabulary of dance.
Occasionally a teacher will come out and say this,
but for the most part it's understood, it's why we're there.
Well that, and the endorphins, and the ethnic rhythms, and....
Taking classes there, I am constantly remembering how
powerful the lessons I learned in music theory were,
and how much fun it was taking Art and Art History classes at VCU.
</p>
<p>
The parallel now is, instead of learning <em>specific dances</em>,
I am learning <em>all of dancing</em>.
Since it came first, Ballet got dibs on naming some of the
most basic of these movements: tendu, plie, degage, etc.
Many of the other dances, especially Jazz and Modern,
add their own character to these basic movements.
An exception of course is West African,
which started an entirely different, less formal, branch.
It has its own vocabulary, but without the terms,
ya just gotta watch it and try it.
How Hip-Hop fits into this scheme is left as an exercise for the reader....
</p>
<p>
Despite Osama and various CEOs,
in May of 2002 I had a job interview
that led to an actual job in September.  Whoo-hoo!
Time off is nice but enough is enough,
the starving artist lifestyle (lots of MacCheese)
definitely gets old after awhile.
I tried going back to partner dancing, but
felt I needed more time before going back to the old
places -- the smoky Salsa bars in particular -- without the ciggies.
So in I decided keep my momentum going at CPRD at least through the showcase,
to continue my "basic training" and laying this foundation for partner dancing.
</p>

<h3>Watching dance performances</h3>
<p>
Taking classes from members of her company is one thing.
When learning dance, it's just as important to go see their performances.
It should go without saying that all of them are awesome.
You should check out Cleo's Dance Ensemble whenever possible!
</p>
<p>
The past several months I've been checking out the fliers people
leave at the school and have been
going to dance performances in the auditorium there
by smaller, less well-known local dance companies.
These are almost always fun:
<ul>
<li>When one of the drummers for the West African classes died,
they had a benefit to raise money to return his body to his home
in Africa.
Denver has three different African dance troupes;
all three performed that night.</li>
<li>We've seen the
<a href="http://www.wheelerjobin.com/clients/hannahkahn/bio.asp"
         onMouseOver="linkStatus();return true;"
         onMouseOut="setStatusToDefault();return true;"
         target="dance_window">
Hannah Kahn Dance Company</a> perform there.</li>
<li>When a musician from the Middle East came to visit the Denver area,
he shared his talents by performing in a concert with local musicians.
The performance included belly dancing and a dance inspired by the
whirling dervish (some of us have seen something similar at Dead shows,
but nothing quite like <em>this</em>).
It was interesting to see that Denver has people who are huge fans
of that type of delicate, intricate Middle Eastern music,
which actually kind of reminds me of bluegrass, in a way....</li>
<li>One night we saw a variety of acts in a program put on by Ballet Arts.
The acts included works in Ballet, Hip-Hop, and
some sort of warlike Modern Dance that was a bit unsettling.
The most memorable performances of the evening were by Teri Westerman,
who won fourth place in an international ballroom dancing competition 
featuring 150 couples from various countries in Europe.
What made her performances so memorable is the fact that she dances in a
<a href="http://www.csdn.org/articles/020303dancingqueen.html"
         onMouseOver="linkStatus();return true;"
         onMouseOut="setStatusToDefault();return true;"
         target="dance_window">
wheelchair</a>.</li>
<li>More recently I saw a performance by the Dirty Laundry Dance Company.
The evening featured many skit-like performances,
one of which was what can only be described as a spank-fest.
Another piece featured a too-happy housewife and
a pile of laundry writhing and coming alive.
Things got messy in that one.
In another piece one of the dancers was wrapped up by the others
in a make-shift structure of mostly duct tape and plastic.</li>
</ul>
<p>
All of these have been very cool.
</p>
<h3>How dancing inspired a new type of jazz</h3>
<p>
Currently I'm reading <em>Miles: The Autobiography</em>, and
it is extremely cool to learn that he was married to a dancer
named

In the quote below, "the modal thing" refers to the type of jazz
he pioneered on the album

</p>
<div class="quote">
<blockquote>
"I had gotten into the modal thing from watching a performance
by the Ballet Africaine from Guinea....
 Anyway, we went to this performance by the Ballet Africaine and
it just fucked me up what they was doing,
the steps and all them flying leaps and shit.... 
It was beautiful. 
And their rhythm! 
The rhythm of the dancers was something. 
I was counting off while I was watching them. 
They were so acrobatic.
They had one drummer watching them dance, doing their flips and shit,
and when they jumped he would play DA DA DA DA POW!
in this bad rhythm. 
He would hit it when they would fall. 
And man, he was catching everybody that did anything. 
The other drummers got them, too. 
So they would do rhythms like 5/4 and 6/8 and 4/4, and
the rhythm would be changing and popping. 
That's the thing, that secret, inner thing that they had. 
It's African. 
I knew I couldn't do it from just watching them dance because
I'm not African, but I loved what they were doing. 
I didn't want to copy that, but I got a concept from it."

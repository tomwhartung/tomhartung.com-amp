<h2>Photo Galleries</h2>
<p>
Just recently I've learned how to use the
<a href="http://gwenview.sourceforge.net/" target="image_window">gwenview</a>
program to export batches of images to a set of web pages called a <em>gallery.</em>
It's quite easy to use &#151; the hard part is choosing which images to publish &#151;
which is how it <em>should</em> be.
</p>
<p>
Following is a partial list of these photo batches.

He was quite hungry so they named him Marvin, after Starvin' Marvin

Fortunately for me, they already had two cats, a dog, and a guinea pig.
I added the middle name because that's how he sounds when he purrs

I really like living in urban environments like this.
In this shot I'm watering another tree I planted in the front yard.
This one's a Grey Gleam Juniper and its name is Jamie,
partly for the alliterative value and partly because there were
lots of Jamies where I went to high school,
but I rarely meet one here in Denver.

I planted Jamie in 1993, the same year I moved in.
Note that I am not sure about the gender of these trees 
so in both cases they're non-gender-specific.

These are some photos of my back yard.

This one is taken from near my back door and
shows part of the garage, along with the barbeque I built
with the assistance of Mark and Dave Gerow.

I've planted a lot of rose bushes in my backyard.
I respect plants with thorns, and also have a

pyracantha</a>
 bush ("guarding" a window I feel may be vulnerable to intruders) and
two indoor cactus gardens.
<br />
Here you can see the two old rose bushes by the garage.
They bloom like gangbusters in the spring.
This year we had a late snow and I had to cut them back shortly
after they bloomed.

Taking care of all this is a bit of work,
but the yard is small so it's not too bad.
I have actually had a lot of fun gardening in the front
and here in the back yard over the years.
